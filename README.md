- then, push on your Repository
- Pull request on My [Repository](https://github.com/afrizal423/where-we-Go)
- When finished Pull request it to this repository. I'll check it first
- If the code is correct and there is no error, then I will merge it from your pull request

### My reason
The reason I made a contribution to this project is because we are learning about algorithms and data structures using the Go programming language. Apart from that we also learned how to contribute to open source projects, and also here we celebrate hacktoberfest. Hopefully for those who contribute to this project, God will bless them, because they help people who are learning.
