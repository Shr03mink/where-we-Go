Hello, welcome to this project.
Here you will work on a Queue. <br>
<b> It should be noted </b> <br>
Here I have struck the following
```
type element struct {
npm string
string name
int semester
}
```
Please develop again using the Queue <br>
Please write the code in the main.go file <br>
The important thing is you can Insert, Display Queue, See First Queue, See last Queue, Count Queue.
