Hello, welcome to this project.
Here you will work on a Stack. <br>
<b> It should be noted </b> <br>
Here I have struck the following
```
type element struct {
name string
}
```
Please develop again using the Stack <br>
Please write the code in the main.go file <br>
The important thing is you can Push, Display all, Pop, Search element, Count Element.
