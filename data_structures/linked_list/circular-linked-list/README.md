Hello, welcome to this project.
Here you will work on a Circular Linked List. <br>
<b> It should be noted </b> <br>
Here I have struck the following
```
type element struct {
npm string
string name
int semester
next * element
}

type singleList struct {
counter int
head * element
}

func initList () * singleList {
return & singleList {}
}
```
Please develop again using the Doubly Linked List. <br>
Please write the code in the main.go file <br>
The important thing is you can Create, Read, Delete, Delete with npm.
<br>
If you are still confused about what it means, please run [main.go](../../../data_structures/linked_list/single-linked-list/main.go)
