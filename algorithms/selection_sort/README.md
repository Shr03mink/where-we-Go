Hello, welcome to this project.
Here you will do Selection Sort.

- Please write the code in the selection_sort.go file
- <b> It should be noted </b>. here I ask you to create a data.txt file in which there are random numbers. These random numbers are then entered into an array for shorting processing.
- If the shorting process is complete, then save it with the file name as result.txt

If you are confused, please see the create data.txt function [here](../../algorithms/bubble_sort/Bubble_sort.go#L13).
and if you are confused about how to read the data.txt file, please see [this](../../algorithms/bubble_sort/Bubble_sort.go#L39) function.
Then to save the results of the shorting processing, see the function create results.txt [here](../../algorithms/bubble_sort/Bubble_sort.go#L62).

If you are still confused about what it means, please run [Bubble_sort.go](../../algorithms/bubble_sort/Bubble_sort.go)
